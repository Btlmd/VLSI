## Abstract

Birthday celebrations have special meaning in most cultures. However, how to present birthday wishes to respected computer vision scholars with wide connections remains rarely studied. To this end, we propose a novel paradigm for birthday congratulations using modern academic collaboration tools and, to the best of our knowledge, presents its first experiments in human history on a *c7w* individual. This framework uses an iterative algorithm to update celebration content and can easily scale to hundreds of collaborators. Extensive experiments manifest that our method brings about tremendous improvement in many key metrics, achieving new state-of-the-art. Code is released at https://github.com/Btlmd/VLSI.

## Usage 

To observe a `c7w`, run the following command

```bash
yarn observe
```

## Acknowledgement

We'd like to especially thank `c7w` for his extraordinary contributions in ANN and Computer Organization projects, without which it would be impossible for us to make this trolling.
